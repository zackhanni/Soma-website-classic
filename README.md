## How to work with your site

In order to preview changes to your site locally, a Ruby environment is required. Your OS may provide you with one, but you will have fewer issues if you use a tool like RVM to install Ruby and provide an environment to install gems. See [RVM installation documentation](https://rvm.io/rvm/install) for more.

With a working Ruby environment, you should be able to type the `bundle` command to install all required dependencies listed in the Gemfile. For more details on installing Jekyll, see the docs [here](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/).

Then, from your command line, you can run the following commands in the directory this file is located:
* `jekyll serve` will spawn a development server that allows you to view your site and review changes you make on-the-fly.

For more Jekyll commands and usage information, see the docs [here](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/usage/).
