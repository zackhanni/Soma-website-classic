<blockquote>"Anytime I encounter audio issues on my video projects, Zack is my go-to guy. May you need audio mastered, mixed, you name it and odds are he can do it. Mind you I live out of his state and I still come to him for the best quality and rates money can buy.<br/>
Five years as his client and looking forward to more. Thanks Zack!" - Felicia Chunn</blockquote>
